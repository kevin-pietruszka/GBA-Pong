This ia simple pong game with a a few hidden easter eggs for paddle customization.

To start the game press start as prompted. The game then waits for you to input as the ball moves fast so the game. The keys
that work here are the Up and Down arrow keys. Other than that the only button you use is select to reset the game. The easter eggs are 
all entered at the start of the game in the menu, and they are certain single button or multi-button presses to activate some different skins.

I added a challenge skin thats a German flag sincethe top third is black which blends into the background. But the paddle still works
as the others, so you have to guess for that extra challenge.
